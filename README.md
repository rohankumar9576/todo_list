# todo_list

Assignment: Todo List Management System
Overview:
Develop a backend application using Node.js and Express.js to manage a todo list. Users should be able to perform CRUD operations on todo items, upload todo items from a CSV file, download the todo list in CSV format, and set a status flag for each todo item.

Tasks:
Project Setup:
Initialize a new Node.js project.
Install necessary dependencies like Express.js, body-parser, mongoose for MongoDB (or mysql for MySQL).
Set up the basic folder structure for the project.
Database Setup:
Set up MongoDB or MySQL database.
Define a schema/table to store todo list items. Include fields for task description, status flag, and any other relevant information.
CRUD API Endpoints:
Implement routes and controllers for CRUD operations on todo list items.
Include functionality to set and update the status flag for todo items.
CSV File Upload:
Create an endpoint for uploading todo items from a CSV file.
Parse the CSV file and save todo items along with their status into the database.
CSV File Download:
Create an endpoint for downloading the todo list in CSV format.
Include the status flag in the CSV output.
Additional Features:
Implement filtering options in the API to fetch todo list items based on their status (e.g., fetching only completed items, only pending items, etc.).
Detailed Requirements:
Database Schema/Table Structure:
TodoItem:
id: Integer
description: String
status: String (e.g., 'pending', 'completed')
API Endpoints:
GET /todos: Fetch all todo items.
GET /todos/:id: Fetch a single todo item by ID.
POST /todos: Add a new todo item.
PUT /todos/:id: Update an existing todo item.
DELETE /todos/:id: Delete a todo item.
POST /todos/upload: Upload todo items from a CSV file.
GET /todos/download: Download the todo list in CSV format.
GET /todos/filter?status=:status: Filter todo list items based on status.
Additional Considerations:
Validation: Implement input validation to ensure that only valid data is accepted by the API.
Authentication & Authorization: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms if required.
Error Handling: Implement proper error handling to provide meaningful error messages to the clients.
Documentation: Document the API endpoints and their usage using tools like Swagger or Postman documentation.
Testing: Test each API endpoint thoroughly using tools like Postman or curl to ensure they work as expected.
